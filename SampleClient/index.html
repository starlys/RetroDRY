        <h3>Quick test suite</h3>
        <div>
            The quick test suite runs tests sequentially with a single client and doesn't look at any timing or multi-user effects.
            It clears the database to start and leaves records in there after it is done, so it must be run before the slow tests.
        </div>
        <div><button onclick="integrationTestContainer.runTestSuite()">Run Quick Test Suite</button></div>
        <h3>Slow test suite</h3>
        <div>
            The slow test suite connects multiple clients and tests subscriptions, timing, abandoned sessions, and other
            more complex cases, and so it takes a long time. Watch the console to view progress.
