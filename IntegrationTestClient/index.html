        <h1>RetroDRY skeletal demo and integration test runner</h1>
        This is written in plain javascript with no bundling/transpiling/etc, so you can see everything without layers of complexity.

        <h2>Run Samples</h2>
        When you click the button, nothing will appear to happen. View the browser console for output, and also view main.js for the 
        functions that get run here.
        <div><button onclick="sampleClient.runSamples()">Run Samples</button></div>

        <h2>Integration tests</h2>
        <div>Open browser console to see integration test output.</div> 
        <h3>Quick test suite</h3>
        <div>
            The quick test suite runs tests sequentially with a single client and doesn't look at any timing or multi-user effects.
            It clears the database to start and leaves records in there after it is done.
        </div>
        <div><button onclick="integrationTestContainer.runTestSuite()">Run Quick Test Suite</button></div>
        <h3>Slow test suite</h3>
        <div>
            The slow test suite connects multiple clients and tests subscriptions, timing, abandoned sessions, and other
            more complex cases. Watch the console to view progress.
            It clears the database to start and leaves records in there after it is done.
        </div>
        <div><button onclick="integrationTestContainer.runSlowTestSuite()">Run Slow Test Suite</button></div>
